# OS-Project-Fire-Detection

So the code our project is in extract.py
The code is about a simple fire detection system using cnn. We have tried to implement OS using pool module.
The code takes images(fire and non fire) as in a dataset and compare the hsv value of teh images after converting them in 128x128 Pixels.

Comparing the values with if else statements we detect the fire and non fire images. For fire images we can make the algorithm sound beep using winmodule.
Overall the project is able to detect fire using image processing with OS implemented.

Thank you for the amazing project wwe learnt a lot of things about the Coding World!
